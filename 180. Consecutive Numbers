Write a SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

+----+-----+
| Id | Num |
+----+-----+
| 1  |  1  |
| 2  |  1  |
| 3  |  1  |
| 4  |  2  |
| 5  |  1  |
| 6  |  2  |
| 7  |  2  |

For example, given the above Logs table, 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.

select Distinct L1.Num AS ConsecutiveNums
From Logs L1, Logs L2, Logs L3
where L1.Num=L2.Num 
    AND L2.Num=L3.Num 
    AND L1.Id=L2.ID-1
    AND L2.ID=L3.ID-1;
