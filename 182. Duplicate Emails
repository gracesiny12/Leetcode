+----+---------+
| Id | Email   |
+----+---------+
| 1  | a@b.com |
| 2  | c@d.com |
| 3  | a@b.com |
+----+---------+

+---------+
| Email   |
+---------+
| a@b.com |
+---------+


Select distinct(p1.Email)
from Person p1
join Person p2
on p1.Email=P2.Email
where p1.Id != p2.Id;


# select Email from
# (
#   select Email, count(Email) as num
#   from Person
#   group by Email
# ) as statistic
# where num > 1;



# select Email
# from Person
# group by Email
# having count(Email) > 1;
